Self-awareness is harnessed through critical perspective and I find this to be helpful to me as a multimedia student, multimedia creator and consumer, and member of the society. From this perspective, I find a better understanding of my privilege and shortcomings in media as well as my own position on how I want multimedia to influence society - by positively transforming it.

          title="Society is not one-dimensional and when analyzing the influence of multimedia on society, a critical perspective allows us to analyze its intersectionality and dynamics. Various points can be observed at varying levels and may be challenged in different ways. Apart from how society is classified, each of its components is looked at, fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and transformative understanding of media's role in society. "

          title="Whenever I employ a critical perspective when analyzing multimedia, I see how it brought upon social transformation as well as the surrounding issues, the areas of development, and even the gaps. Critically viewing the multimedia reveals the sectors untouched by the multimedia. The fast-paced development of our interconnected world calls for the battle of the fittest. The remote areas and some regarded cultures still have barriers to fitting in to interconnect. I see from this perspective that changing is not the total answer but just allowing them to connect with us.

From a critical perspective, multimedia is not simply identified at the surface level. Critical questions are also employed which honestly are not just about scrutinizing for negativity, they are also helpful in finding the best in situations. With the informed insights that this leads to, actions, emulations, and rejections can be applied accordingly.

Therefore, from this perspective, viewing the influence of multime on society is not just at the surface level, but rather it involves digging deeper into the underlying complexities. "

The recipient of the commodity also has a role to play. Looking after the influence of multimedia on society also requires checking on the mechanisms within the society that made the influencing possible, and a critical perspective empowers the possibility of doing so.
